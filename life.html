        <!-- <p>Hello, my name is Elizabeth - I’m 20 years old and currently a computer science student at New York University, and pursuing a minor in mathematics and web programming.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of interest in web development and that is my primary professional experience. However, in the long run I would love to become a full stack developer.</p>
        <p>Outside of computer science, I have a variety of interests and hobbies. I enjoy artistic projects, fashion, going to the gym, travelling, and adventuring for food. I like to live a jam packed life and to always be doing something.</p>
        <p>Someone I really admire is Leonardo Da Vinci. Like him, I strive to become a well rounded person who excels in a variety of fields. I don’t want to limit myself just to computer science, but want to pursue my different interests and be able to utilize my technical skills when applicable.</p> -->

        <h1>experience</h1>
        <h2><a href="https://avexdesigns.com/" target="blank">avex designs</a></h2>
        <p>Avex Designs is a creative digital agency and web design company based in New York City. During my time with Avex as a web developer, I worked on a variety of websites for clients such as
          <a href="http://www.rocawear.com/" target="blank">Rocawear</a>,
          <a href="http://clarkmcdowall.com/" target="blank">Clark McDowall</a>,
          <a href="http://santinoloconte.com/" target="blank">Santino Loconte</a>, and
          <a href="https://starmountaincapital.com/" target="blank">Star Mountain Capital</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The work I did for clients ranged from creating a website from a blank wordpress to making tweeks and updates to an existing site. In addition, I also added many interactions through Javascript to create more elevated and luxurious websites.</p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I also personally managed a handful of clients. I was in charge of managing communications between the agency and the clients, and fulfilling client requests for site changes.</p>

        <h2><a href="" target="blank">glory child</a></h2>
        <p>Glory Child is a clothing brand I started summer of 2015. It was a small scale project I did just for personal fun and interest. I made approximately $3,000 in revenue and had 2,000+ visitors within the first two days of launch. As a one (wo)man project, I was responsible for everything from designing, to creating the store website, to marketing and management.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am taking a break from Glory Child to focus on school.</p>
